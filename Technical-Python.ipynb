    "1. GET METHOD : The GET method is used to retrieve or fetch data from a server without modifying it. It is the most commonly used HTTP method, and it is considered safe and idempotent, meaning multiple identical GET requests will have the same effect and won’t change the server's state. For example, when a user visits a web page or requests a list of users from a REST API, a GET request is sent to the server. The server responds with the requested data, usually in JSON or HTML format. Since GET does not carry a request body, any parameters are typically passed in the URL as query strings or path variables.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2.  POST METHOD : The POST method is used to send data to the server to create a new resource. It is not idempotent, which means sending the same POST request multiple times may result in multiple new resources being created. This method is typically used when submitting a form, registering a new user, or adding a new item to a database. The data is usually sent in the request body in JSON format. For example, when a client sends a POST request to /api/users with a JSON object containing user details, the server processes it and creates a new user record in the database, responding with the newly created data and a 201 Created status code.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. PUT METHOD : The PUT method is used to update or replace an existing resource on the server. It is idempotent, meaning sending the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. A PUT request typically targets a specific resource identified by its ID, such as /api/users/1, and replaces the entire content of that resource with the data provided in the request body. This method is suitable for full updates, where the entire object is redefined. If the resource does not exist, some APIs may create it, although this behavior can vary depending on implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  DELETE METHOD  : The DELETE method is used to remove a specific resource from the server. Like PUT, DELETE is also idempotent, meaning deleting the same resource multiple times will have the same effect — it remains deleted. For instance, a DELETE request to /api/users/1 will instruct the server to remove the user with ID 1 from the database. If the resource is successfully deleted, the server usually returns a 200 OK or 204 No Content status. If the resource doesn't exist, a 404 Not Found status might be returned. This method is crucial for resource management in RESTful services."
